<h1>Flight Processing System</h1>

This project involves building a module to process airline flights within a system. A flight is defined as the transportation of a passenger from one point to another, potentially with intermediate stops.

A flight can be seen as a collection of one or more elementary movements, referred to as segments. A segment is an atomic transportation unit characterized by only two attributes: departure datetime and arrival datetime.
